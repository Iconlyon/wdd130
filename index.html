        <h1>Lyon Iorngulum | WDD 130</h1>
        <p>My name is Lyon, and I am a new student in this class. I have a strong interest in
            technology,
            particularly web development, ICT, and software engineering. I enjoy learning new
            skills,
            solving problems, and collaborating with others. I’m excited to learn in this class,
            share
            ideas, and work together with everyone. Nice to meet you all!</p>
